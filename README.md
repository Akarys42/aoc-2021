# Advent of Code 2021

My solution to the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) programming challenges. You can find the solution of each part in each daily folder, along with some visualisations and their rendered output in the images folder. 

You will need Python 3.10 to run those solutions. The code is linted using [Black](https://github.com/psf/black).

# Index

# Timing

Below is a table taking by the full resolution of each puzzle, taking the interpreter startup and shutdown time into account.

The higher the timing is, the more accurate it should be. Hence, anything under 100ms has been replaced with a dash.

Each part is run a few times -depending on the overall time taken- and the best time is reported in the table.

ยน not a typo, I will have to investigate that one at some point and perhaps backport part 2
