# Advent of Code 2021

My solution to the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) programming challenges. You can find the solution of each part in each daily folder, along with some visualisations and their rendered output in the images folder. 

You will need Python 3.10 to run those solutions. The code is linted using [Black](https://github.com/psf/black).
